ContextAgent is an AI assistant backend designed for document-based question answering using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It uses a modular architecture that blends LangChain, OpenAI, FastAPI, and ChromaDB to build robust, production-ready workflows. The system handles diverse document formats, supports multi-tool agents, preserves conversational memory, and provides fast semantic search over large knowledge bases. It ships with Docker for straightforward deployment and scaling.

What ContextAgent is for
ContextAgent targets teams and individuals who need a scalable AI assistant that can read, reason about, and answer questions from a corpus of documents. It is built to support enterprises, researchers, and developers who want to customize and extend a knowledge base with minimal friction. The backend focuses on document-centric questions, where answers draw from indexed content rather than generic training data alone.

Core capabilities
- Document ingestion and processing
  - PDF, Word (Docx), and Markdown handling
  - Content extraction, normalization, and metadata tagging
- Vector search and semantic retrieval
  - ChromaDB as the vector store
  - Fast, precise similarity search over embeddings
- RAG-based question answering
  - Retrieval augmented generation with large language models (LLMs)
  - Contextual responses derived from retrieved passages
- Conversational memory
  - Short-term context tracking for smooth, coherent chats
  - Long-term memory options for ongoing projects
- Modular multi-tool agents
  - Orchestrates several tools to gather data, summarize, or transform content
  - Flexible branching for complex queries
- Production-ready deployment
  - Docker-based setup with sensible defaults
  - Configurable components for scale and reliability
- Extensible architecture
  - Clear module boundaries
  - Simple extension points for custom tools, data sources, or processing steps

How it works
- The user sends a query to the FastAPI endpoint.
- The system retrieves relevant documents using a semantic search against the vector store.
- Retrieved content is condensed and fed to an LLM via LangChain prompts.
- The LLM generates an answer, optionally augmented with citations from the retrieved passages.
- The conversation maintains memory to provide context-aware follow-ups and refinements.
- Documents can flow through a processing pipeline that handles PDFs, Word documents, and Markdown, converting them into searchable embeddings for the vector store.
- A multi-tool agent orchestrates ancillary tasks (like summarization, translation, or extraction) to produce richer responses when needed.

Notes on licensing and attribution
- The project follows standard open source practices with attribution for contributors and dependencies.
- When deploying in production, ensure compliance with licensing terms of the embedded LLM providers and vector stores.

End-to-end example walkthrough
- Suppose you have a collection of manuals in PDF and Markdown.
- You ingest the documents into ContextAgent, which extracts text and metadata, then creates embeddings and stores them in ChromaDB.
- A user asks: “How do I reset the device using the latest manual?”
- The system search retrieves the most relevant sections. The LLM composes an answer that cites the exact passages from the manuals.
- If the user asks for more details, the memory module keeps the context and suggests follow-up questions or deeper explanations.
- If the user needs a quick summary of a long document, a specialized tool is invoked to produce a concise abstract.

Release and maintenance hub
- The Releases page is the primary source for stable builds, release notes, and upgrade recommendations.
- You can revisit the release page at any time to confirm which versions are compatible with your deployment strategy and data governance requirements.
- The release hub provides ready-to-run artifacts and the latest improvements to the ingestion, search, and memory subsystems.

Community and collaboration
- Feedback channels exist for reporting issues, requesting features, and contributing improvements.
- Engaging with the community helps align features with real-world workflows and use cases.

- It emphasizes clarity in prompts, memory handling, and the orchestration of tools so teams can customize workflows quickly.
- Where possible, examples use concrete data and end-to-end scenarios to illustrate how to apply ContextAgent in different settings.

Extensibility and customization
- The system is designed to be extended with new document formats, new tools, and new memory strategies.
- You can replace the vector store with an alternative backend or swap the LLM provider with minimal changes to the orchestration layer.
- Custom prompts can be authored to fit industry-specific needs, maintain tone, and improve answer quality.

Usage tips and best practices
- Start with a well-scoped ingestion set to keep the initial index manageable.
- Tune the prompt templates for your domain to improve relevance and citation quality.
- Enable memory for conversational continuity but monitor privacy implications and data retention.
- Use tools to offload specialized tasks, such as long-form summarization or language translation, when needed.
- Regularly review release notes to adopt improvements and ensure compatibility with your data.

License and warranty
- The project includes standard open source licensing to foster collaboration.
- Use of the backend with LLMs means you should respect the terms of service and usage policies of the chosen providers.
- The repository is provided as-is with community-driven improvements and does not replace formal vendor support.
